                of the world in 2020, confusion and doubt were and 
	        are my primary modes of being. This repository was 
		designed as a way for me to make sense of the world. 
		It in no way represents any clear opinions, divisions
		, or assumptions that I hold on any given topic. My 
		hope is that it will serve as an excellent resource 
		for comparing viewpoints and researching the changing 
		landscape of information delivery. As this was created 
		as mere meditation, and a way for me to learn web 
		design principles, I welcome any and all feedback.
