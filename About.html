            of the world in 2020, confusion and doubt were and
            are my primary modes of being. This repository was
            designed as a place for me to make sense of the world.
            It in no way represents any clear opinions, divisions
            , or assumptions that I hold on any given topic. My
            hope is that it will serve as an excellent resource
            for comparing viewpoints and researching the changing
            landscape of information delivery. As this was created
            as mere meditation, and a way for me to learn web
            design principles, I welcome any and all feedback.
            If you would like to reach out to me please use the
            form below.</font>
